# Welcome to my Capstone Project

_This project was written as part of the Meta Front-End Developer course. This project is peer-graded, which means if you're here, you probably also took the course. If you've completed it, you most likely ran into the problem where the API file was not found. You probably had to write your own or find someone else's work-around. I took Omar Gaafar's solution from [this](https://www.coursera.org/learn/meta-front-end-developer-capstone/discussions/forums/f1M3RrlHEe2qmAqrCd7t4Q/threads/GY8m40dYEe66bBLEH6-jOQ) link and changed some things: I made it so the app keeps track of the previous bookings and removes the booked times from the available times. It also tells you if the selected day is full._

_Some things I would add if this was a real app: making sure the user cannot book a table in the past. As of now, users are able to book on any day on the calendar._
