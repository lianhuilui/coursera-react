# My Capstone Project

## Hello, there!

To fellow peers: Welcome to my solution/submission.

To everyone else: This project was written as part of the Meta Front-End Developer course. This project is peer-graded.

## Missing API link

If you've completed it, you most likely ran into the problem where the API file was not found. You probably had to write your own or find someone else's work-around. I took Omar Gaafar's solution from [this](https://www.coursera.org/learn/meta-front-end-developer-capstone/discussions/forums/f1M3RrlHEe2qmAqrCd7t4Q/threads/GY8m40dYEe66bBLEH6-jOQ) link and changed some things: I made it so the app keeps track of the previous bookings and removes the booked times from the available times. It also tells you if the selected day is full.

See it in my

## Future Fixes

(if this was a real app), I would make sure the user cannot book a table in the past.
 
## Final thoughts

I'm glad you've made it this far and (hopefully) completed the course. With so many missing parts in the course that hindered our learning, we still found a way. Kudos!
